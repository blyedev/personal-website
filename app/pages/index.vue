      I'm a DevOps Engineer, formerly a Full-Stack Developer based in Munich
      ü•®üç∫.

    <p>
      Today I focus mostly on build reproducability and IaC pipelines at
      <NuxtLink to="https://www.xalt.de/" target="_blank">XALT</NuxtLink>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also study Information Systems at TUM, where I circle around
      cybersecurity, distributed computing, process optimization, and...
      accounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm a huge fan of the ‚ÄúDotfile Renaissance‚Äù as I believe a developer‚Äôs
      workflow should center around the terminal. Both my

      and my

      config are open-sourced on GitHub for anyone to see. I generally try to
      open source as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>I hope to share write-ups of projects I worked on here.</p>
