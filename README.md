# Adam Smielewski's Personal Website

The following personal website utilizes nuxt's server side generation functionality to generate a fully static blog deployed to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) as a backend.

Due to German laws requiring an Impressum I have not published the website yet until I rent a virtual office to avoid leaking my adress.
